# Debugify
## What the hell is Debugify?
Debugify is a community project to clean up the forgotten bugs of Minecraft found on the Minecraft bug tracker, fixing those pesky bugs with a low priority from Mojang that they never get around to.

## What does this mod replace?
This mod replaces many mods and implements fixes from some others
- **[FastOpenLinksAndFolders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastopenlinksandfolders)**: Replaced
- **[Shift-Scroll Fix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shift-scroll-fix)**: Replaced
- **[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**: Replaced
- **[TieFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tiefix)**: Semi-replaced - some fixes have been implemented

All of these mods have helped us create Debugify. We thank you very much for your effort! We made sure to follow the license of every one of these mods when creating our own version.

## Can I include this in my modpack?
Yes! Of course! We even hid a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain, so we added a hidden config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.
```json
{
  ...
  "default_disabled": true
}
```
